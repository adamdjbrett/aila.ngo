_The truth, while spoken, never dies._   
_It is a flame that may rest, smouldering in our bones._   
_Perhaps for generations_  
_Yet in these very lines it will rekindle_  
_We are the flame that never died on battlegrounds of old_  
_And for as long as I breathe my story_  
_I am not vanquished_  
_I am my fallen ancestors, risen again, each time our tale is told_  
_Still here today, a laughing, dancing, love-making testament_  
_against any notion of conquest,_  
_Speaking our truth, singing of those who slipped between the privileged pages of history_  
_Loving new generations into being_  
_New bearers of the flame_  
_That never dies_.

Like the rings of a tree, the record of our people, our indigenous truth, is carried in the bones of indigenous women, which we bear forth with every birth onto our lands. Our bodies bear the testament of colonial invasion by empires both state and corporate and the stories continue through the bloodlines of indigenous survivors. While settler colonial governments present terrorist atrocities as aberrations, carried out by others - we carry the truth that terrorists atrocities began with the arrival of colonialism and continue everyday in the violent systems upheld by settler colonial governments. In this dialogue between Sovereign Women held amongst Māori and Pacific artworks on the Doctrine of Discovery, Indigenous truths will be woven from the past to the present with a vision to the future and across continents between Māori and Haudenosaunee Nations. **Panelists**:

*   Betty Lyons (Onondaga, Snipe Clan)
*   Beverly Jacobs (Kanienkehaka, Bear Clan)
*   Dawn Martin-Hill (Mohawk, Wolf Clan)
*   Tina Ngata (Māori, Ngati Porou)
