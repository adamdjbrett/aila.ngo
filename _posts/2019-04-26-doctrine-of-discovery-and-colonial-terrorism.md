<em>The truth, while spoken, never dies.</em>
<em>It is a flame that may rest, smouldering in our bones.</em>
<em>Perhaps for generations</em>
<em>Yet in these very lines it will rekindle</em>
<em>We are the flame that never died on battlegrounds of old</em>
<em>And for as long as I breathe my story</em>
<em>I am not vanquished</em>
<em>I am my fallen ancestors, risen again, each time our tale is told</em>
<em>Still here today, a laughing, dancing, love-making testament</em>
<em>against any notion of conquest,</em>
<em>Speaking our truth, singing of those who slipped between the privileged pages of history</em>
<em>Loving new generations into being</em>
<em>New bearers of the flame</em>
<em>That never dies</em>.

Like the rings of a tree, the record of our people, our indigenous truth, is carried in the bones of indigenous women, which we bear forth with every birth onto our lands. Our bodies bear the testament of colonial invasion by empires both state and corporate and the stories continue through the bloodlines of indigenous survivors. While settler colonial governments present terrorist atrocities as aberrations, carried out by others - we carry the truth that terrorists atrocities began with the arrival of colonialism and continue everyday in the violent systems upheld by settler colonial governments. In this dialogue between Sovereign Women held amongst Māori and Pacific artworks on the Doctrine of Discovery, Indigenous truths will be woven from the past to the present with a vision to the future and across continents between Māori and Haudenosaunee Nations.
