We want to share this new op-ed, "[Dreamers Must be Protected - as Indigenous Peoples Were Not](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/03/dreamers-daca-indigenous-peoples-americas)," by Betty Lyons, President of the American Indian Law Alliance, which was published today in The Guardian.

Please share and post this op-ed on social media. We're using the hashtag: [#HumanRightsCannotBeD<wbr>eferred](https://twitter.com/#HumanRightsCannotBeDeferred).


> For us, DACA is not an immigration crisis. It is a human rights crisis. And human rights cannot be deferred. Every day approximately 122 people lose DACA protection. This cruel policy immorally punishes and traumatizes innocent young people and their families._As Indigenous Peoples, we know our history and we know our relatives. Many so-called "undocumented" people are in fact Indigenous Peoples, children of Original Nations with a millennial history of travel across the continent to trade and engage in ceremonial obligations at sacred sites of their traditional territories before the US existed._
