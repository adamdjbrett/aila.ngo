Our **Purpose** at the American Indian Law Alliance is to work with Indigenous Nations, communities and organizations globally, in our struggle for sovereignty, human rights and social justice for our peoples, while remaining committed to our original instructions handed down through our ancestors in order to preserve Indigenous traditions for the seventh generation yet to come. Our **vision** is to empower Indigenous communities by being the catalyst for the advancement of self-determination, in order to promote our social, economic and cultural development. We do this through education, capacity building and legal advocacy. Our ultimate **goal **is based on the principle of the seventh generation. By working with Indigenous Nations and communities globally, we seek to further the defense of Mother Earth, and leave behind a healthy world for the next seven generations.
